# FibonaccIt README

FibonaccIt is an Visual Studio Code Extension to apply an Fibonacci-Styled formatting to your code.
  - Applies Code to active Editor-Window
  - Reformats to (Visual Studio Code) Default-Settings, based on your language (if there is an Formatter installed).

This obviously messes with code that uses identation - don't use with Python, etc. You can revert changes with 'Ctrl' + 'Z'

# How to run the tool
When installing the Extension, there will be a new command on the right side of the files you opened in the editor.
From here you can either format your code or reformat it to Visual Studio Code Default.
  
# Changed Settings
When running the FibonaccIt Command the tool changes the indention of the document to "spaces".
If you have the "Reformat on Save" enabled the changes get reverted, obviously. Disable that by yourself!
